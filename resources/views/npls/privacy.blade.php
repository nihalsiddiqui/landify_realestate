                    <strong style="font-size: 2.7rem;"><b>Identifying Purposes</b></strong>
                    <p>
                        We collect, use, and disclose personal information to provide you with the product or service you have requested. Plus, we keep a look out for additional products and services we believe you might be interested in.

In certain circumstances, the purposes for which information is collected may be clear, and consent may be implied. For instance, your name, address and payment information is provided as part of the order process.
                    </p>
                    <strong style="font-size: 2.7rem;"><b>Consent</b></strong>
                    <p>
                        Knowledge and consent are required for the collection, use, or disclosure of personal information except where required or permitted by law. Providing us with your Personal Information is always your choice. However, your decision not to provide certain information may limit our ability to provide you with the best version of our products or services.

If you use our transaction services, we might ask you for more data (income, credit score, housing history).
